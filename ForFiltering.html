we will have to set up some values in context state.
then later on we will also set up a function: handleChange function as well as we will pass them down to a filter component. And, we will attach them to each and every component.

Obviously, not all the values from the state but that 
particular value just so we can control the input.

const RoomContext = React.createContext();

state = {
	type: 'all'
}

this is obviously our first select. 

so we have set up the values in a state before we start working on our handle change, I would also want to make few changes here. 

Notice that we are using this.setState 

handleChange =event => {
	const type = event.target.type;
	const name = event.target.name;
	const value = event.target.value;
	console.log(type,name,value);
}

now, eventually we will come up with another method once we are done changing the values. because what we are going to do with this function is we are going to grab everything that controlled inputs are gonna give us and we are going to fix the values in the state. 

 so notice that we have a bunch of properties So we are going to access those properties adn change it from within this handleChange function. 

and hten once we run the function after that we are going to run another function which will call filterRooms that will not look for any arguments. it will just grab teh values from the state and filter rooms. And, at the moment we can just say hello.


filterRooms = () => {
	console.log('hello');
}

Type Filter:
One we have our general setup in the context.js i think this is the great time to head over to the room filter. 

NOw i am going to be importing right now useContext which is a latest way how we an actually access and this one will be using the hooks. 

return (
	<section className="filter-container">
		<form className="filter-form">
			{/* select type */}
			<div className="form-group">
				<label htmlFor="type">Room Type</label>
				<select 
				name="type" 
				id="type" 
				value={type}
				onChange ={handleChange}
				>
			</div>
			
		</form>
	</section>
)

value will be the type that i am getting from the context 

Now we are missing the values we are getting from the state. in data.js for each and every room there will be type of room. now the thing is though that i just dont want all the rooms that i have becoz types are obviously going to be repeating.
lets say if you are scrolling up a little bit you will notice that lets say type is single. then when i go to next room- it is going to be single again. so i want only unique values.
