Remove auth and do yarn

_auth = aDM3OTE3OTpBUDcyNGRmVU04Q1BkSnRuaUhqWmg1UTZzVEU=
email = Anushree.Shakya@Honeywell.com
always-auth = true


@hw:registry=https://artifactory-na.honeywell.com/artifactory/api/npm/hmiweb-npm-stable-local/
@scuf:registry=https://artifactory-na.honeywell.com/artifactory/api/npm/SCUF-10305-stable-npm-local/
@cpsui:registry=https://artifactory-na.honeywell.com/artifactory/api/npm/Connected-Performance-Services-8877-stable-npm-virtual/

and then add auth and do yarn.

if there is error regarding scuff-common or something like that.

"@scuf/analytics": "^0.52.17",
"@scuf/dashboard": "^0.52.18",
"@scuf/datatable": "^0.52.18",

3. while installing webpack got an error: Maximum call stack size exceeded

Removed the contents from .npmrc file 
Home Machintosh HD > Users > anushreeshakya > .npmrc

and tried the command again

npm install webpack --save-dev

4. Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'dist/bundle.js' in '/Users/anushreeshakya/codes/react-components'

--output must be specified explicitly. type the following code in the command line

"build": "webpack src/js/app.js --output dist/bundle.js --mode development"



Commands:

https://confluence.honeywell.com/display/SENUI/Getting+Started

On your .npmrc file
@hw:registry=https://artifactory-na.honeywell.com/artifactory/api/npm/hmiweb-npm-stable-local/
@scuf:registry=https://artifactory-na.honeywell.com/artifactory/api/npm/SCUF-10305-stable-npm-local/
@cpsui:registry=https://artifactory-na.honeywell.com/artifactory/api/npm/Connected-Performance-Services-8877-stable-npm-virtual/
@forge:registry=https://artifactory-na.honeywell.com/artifactory/api/npm/hub-npm-stable-local/ 

dont use you auth when you are installing anything related to artifactory

_auth = aDM3OTE3OTpBUDcyNGRmVU04Q1BkSnRuaUhqWmg1UTZzVEU=
email = Anushree.Shakya@Honeywell.com
always-auth = true

1. you need to add @forge
yarn global add @forge/cli

1. you need to create forge experience. for that you need to have @forge


create forge experience: 


forge experience:create hcp-datatable
forge experience:preview ./src/index.tsx



git config --global user.email "anushree.shakya@honywell.com"
git config --global user.name "Anushree"

Anything related to the artifactory shouldnt have the auth. remove it.

5. Problems starting CPS-UI

CPI-UI is an application that required backend. cannot be started with yarn start.
Dunko can provide a link if you want to see it run but wont be able to debug.
you can only check the codes there. 
codes for icons for datatables and how datatables are named.
it is an angular project.
