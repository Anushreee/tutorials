The spec files are unit tests for your source files. The convention for Angular applications is to have a .spec.ts file for each .ts file. They are run using the Jasmine javascript test framework through the Karma test runner (https://karma-runner.github.io/) when you use the ng test command.

TypeScript Configuration
TypeScript is a primary language for Angular application development. It is a superset of JavaScript with design-time support for type safety and tooling.

Browsers can't execute TypeScript directly. Typescript must be "transpiled" into JavaScript using the tsc compiler, which requires some configuration.

This page covers some aspects of TypeScript configuration and the TypeScript environment that are important to Angular developers, including details about the following files:

tsconfig.json—TypeScript compiler configuration.
typings—TypesScript declaration files.

What is a decorator in programming?
In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

Decorators provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions. By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.Aug 22, 2018
