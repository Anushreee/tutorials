import React from 'react';

interface Task {
    title: string;
}

interface Props {
    tasks: Task[];
}

class TasksList extends React.Component<Props> {
    
    render() {
        const {tasks} = this.props; // we should take this props from the global state provided by redux
        return(
            <ul>
                {tasks.map((task)=>{
                    return <li>{task.title}</li>
                })}
            </ul>
        )
    }



We should take this props from the global state provided by redux. 
const {tasks} = this.props; 

And, inorder to pass state to this component, we use react-redux connect function. It takes some parameters and the component.

it takes some parameters and the component.

it takes some parameters and the component and wraps it into hoc.
it takes some parameters and the compnent and wraps it into hoc that passes all the state parameters this component may need. lets describe this.

we will export another component and call it connectedTaskList


ConnectedTaskList is connected to state. 

we import connect function from react-redux
import 'connect' from 'react-redux';

And, this function call returns another function that takes the component. and wraps it into hoc.

connect()(TasksList);

And, the first call takes the arguments: two functions

one is to map state into component props. another one is to match Dispatch actions to the component props.

lets see how to use this function. i will command click on it. and now we can see its signatures. it has multiple overloads. 
and the one we need is the one which has 4 generic parameters, 
1. Parameters for the props that should come from the state.
2. Parameters for the Dispatch Props.
3. then we should pass the interface that describes the components own props. 
4. and the app's global state interface as well. 

the type for own props describes the props the component exposes. these are the props that are not taken from the state. 



interface StateProps {
    
}

First we should describe the interface for the props that should come from State. And this is the tasks list props. we will take it from the global state. and we can name this interface AllProps.

And, it will extends all the other interfaces that describe other types of props. For the moment it is the StateProps. 

interface StateProps {
    tasks: Task[];
}

interface AllProps extends StateProps {
    
}

export class TasksList extends React.Component<AllProps>

    So, we have the first generic type parameter we need. lets place it to the connect function. 

    export const ConnectedTasksList = connect<StateProps>()

        Now,we need to describe the dispatchProps. lets create another interface.

        interface DispatchProps {

    }

    this interface contains methods that dispatch some actions. and in our case, i would like to have the method that fetches tasks. this function dispatches some actions to redux. and, doesnt return anything.

    interface DispatchProps {
        fetchTasks: () => void;
    }

    and the AllProps interface should extend this interface as well.

    interface AllProps extends StateProps,DispatchProps {}

     export const ConnectedTasksList = connect<StateProps,DispatchProps,OwnProps>()

     and the next parameter is the OwnProps. lets create this interface.

     and again, AllProps should extend it.

     interface AllProps extends StateProps,DispatchProps, OwnProps {}

     and the last generic type parameter we need is the State.

     lets describe state into the reducer file. 

     reducer.ts

     export interface AppState {

    }

    And for now AppState has one property state which is a list of tasks. 



export const ConnectedTasksList = connect<StateProps,DispatchProps,OwnProps,AppState>()(TaskList);

4th Part:


Now, lets create the function that maps state to props and we pass it as the first argument to connect. 
=======
Now, lets create the function taht maps state to props and we pass it as the first argument to connect. 
>>>>>>> 81cbcc5a122befb636519e5263ee7f636a631b73


export const ConnectedTasksList = connect<StateProps,DispatchProps,OwnProps,AppState>(state=>({
    tasks: state.tasks
}))(TaskList);

And, becoz we listed all the types as generic type parameters for the connect function, Typescript is able to infer that this state is the AppState. and this function should return the stateProps interface. 

so this function takes state and then returns the props that are described by this StateProps interface. 

interface StateProps {
    tasks: Task[];
}

so we should return the tasks.
state =>({tasks: state.tasks})

Also, lets implement the other function that maps dispatchers to props. it takes one argument: the dispatch funciton. and returns the object described by the dispatch props interface. and, we need the fetch task dispatcher. and this is the function that calls dispatch with the necessary action creator. 

dispatch => ({
    fetchTasks: ()=> dispatch()
})

so let create the action creator for the fetchTasks action. 


    interface DispatchProps {
        fetchTasks: () => void;
    }

---------------5th Task------------

actions.ts

I will create another file called actions and export the fetch task action creator from here.

export const fetchTasksAction = () => ({
    type: 
})

action creator should return the action object which contains the type property.

lets describe this action object in another interface. 

import {Action} from 'redux';

export interface fetchTasksAction extends Action{
    
}

export const fetchTasks = () => ({
    type:
})

Redux provides us with the action interface that we should extend.  And, this interface takes one generic type parameter. It take the type parameter to describe the type property.  and for the fetchTasks Action i wiould like to name the  type
<'FETCH_TASKS'>

export interface fetchTasks extends Action<'FETCH_TASKS'>

And, in the action creator lets describe this action.

export const fetchTasks =():FetchTasksAction
